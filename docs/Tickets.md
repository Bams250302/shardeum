I'll help create a focused test plan for the basic silver ticket setup. Let me verify each step.

```bash
cd x-tools-load-tester-v2 && npx hardhat sign_tickets --help
```

```bash
cd x-tools-load-tester-v2 && npx hardhat
```


I see we're already in the load tester directory. Let me verify the network configuration.

Read file: x-tools-load-tester-v2/hardhat.config.ts


Based on my analysis, here's a simplified step-by-step guide to create and test silver tickets:

# Basic Silver Ticket Testing Guide

## Prerequisites
1. Clone the Shardeum repository
2. Install dependencies in both `x-tools-load-tester-v2` and main project

## Step 1: Create Required Addresses
1. Create 2 signer addresses and 1 validator address using MetaMask or any Ethereum wallet
   ```
   Signer 1: (save both address and private key)
   Signer 2: (save both address and private key)
   Validator: (save both address and private key)
   ```

## Step 2: Configure Environment
1. In `x-tools-load-tester-v2`, create a `.env` file:
   ```
   multiSigPrivateKeys=["SIGNER1_PRIVATE_KEY","SIGNER2_PRIVATE_KEY"]
   ```

2. In `archive-server/archiver-config.json`, add signer addresses to `allowedTicketSigners`:
   ```json
   "tickets": {
     "allowedTicketSigners": {
       "SIGNER1_ADDRESS": 5,
       "SIGNER2_ADDRESS": 5
     },
     "minSigRequired": 1,
     "requiredSecurityLevel": 5
   }
   ```

## Step 3: Create Silver Ticket List
1. Navigate to `x-tools-load-tester-v2`
2. Run the sign_tickets task:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat sign_tickets
   ```
3. Select "Create a new list" when prompted
4. Enter the validator address when prompted
5. Confirm the details
6. Choose to sign with one of the signer keys
7. When asked about saving, choose "To file" and specify the path as `../archive-server/static/tickets.json`

## Step 4: Start Local Network
1. Start your local network with the archive server configuration that includes your ticket settings
2. Verify the network is running and the archive server is accessible

## Step 5: Verify Setup
1. Check archive server endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4000/tickets
   ```
   Should return your ticket list

## Step 6: Verify Setup
1. Check archive server endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4000/tickets
   ```
   Should return your ticket list

2. Try to join the network with the validator node:
   ```bash
   # Use validator address and private key to join network
   # The exact command depends on your network configuration
   ```

Would you like me to verify any specific step or provide more details about any part of this process?
