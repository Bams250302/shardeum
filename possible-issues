Open Questions:
- crack logs a lot, but nothing else after that - possibly an error happening after crack (on shardus-core side)
- make sure you turn on more verbose logging when testing
- does nonce need to be increased on the source account?
- use applyResponseSetFailed when there is an error with apply (applyClaimRewardTx does it)
- The recipient of a secure account transfer is an EVMWrapped account - does updating its balance require doing the stateManager.checkpoint + putAccount + commit?
- Why do none of the other apply fns calculate the hashes manually? Maybe this is already handled by applyResponseAddChangedAccount?
- Do we need to generate a receipt for the transfer from source to receipient seperately from the receipt for the secure account transfer multisig itself?
- Timestamp for tx is calculated as the cycle time * 1000, im not actually sure if thats correct or not.

Addressed:
- secure account timestamp not being updated in tx apply
